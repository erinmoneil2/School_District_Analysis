## Overview 

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to help the school board gather data on the standards of teaching by measuring math and reading standardized tests. The purpose of this challegne specifically is to more accurately reflect the data of Thomas High School by removing all of the grades for 9th graders in Thomas High School due to potentialy acedimic dishonestly. We will then compare to see if the schools from the original analysis differ from the data after the 9th graders are removed.

Since the 9th Grade Scores are filled with NaN, the percentage only accounts for the 10th-12th graders. The Average Math score does decrease ever so slightly, indicating that if there was academic dishonesty, the grades may have been higher for the 9th graders due to the indiscretion.
